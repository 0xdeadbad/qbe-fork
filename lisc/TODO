- implement mini-pascal -> ssa
- do naming properly with namespaces
- clean the constants handling (add
  support for labelled data, ...)
- add basic support for integer calls
- write a pattern matching compiler
  for the instruction selector
- handle various addressing modes
  for instructions (how to encode
  available modes for instructions?)

Non pressing:
- rework the hinting in rega
