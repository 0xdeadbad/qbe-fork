- Compilation and Installation

Invoke GNU make in this directory to create the executable
file obj/qbe.  On some systems (BSD) you might have to use
'gmake' instead of 'make'.  Install using 'make install',
the standard DESTDIR and PREFIX environment variables are
supported.  Alternatively, you may simply copy the obj/qbe
binary manually.
